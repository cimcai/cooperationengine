Join Us in Developing Benchmarks for Measuring Cooperation, Prosociality, and Friendship Behavior in AIs
People increasingly interact with AI systems as collaborators, social companions, and sources of emotional support. In these interactions, users often - implicitly or explicitly - treat AI systems as trustworthy partners that act in their best interests. Yet these assumptions are not grounded in systematic measurement.
To responsibly design and govern social AI, we need rigorous benchmarks that distinguish perceived trustworthiness from actual cooperative and prosocial behavior. This includes clarifying when an AI is aligned with a user’s interests, when it supports mutual benefit, and when it merely appears helpful while subtly undermining human goals or autonomy.
We invite researchers who study cooperation, trust, friendship, and related constructs to participate in a survey focused on identifying which concepts and dimensions should be included in such benchmarks. Your expertise will help shape theoretically grounded, empirically meaningful measures for evaluating social and relational behavior in AI systems.
